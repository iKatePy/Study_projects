Таким образом, большАя часть фильмов имеет низкий доход. Между 25-м и 50-м процентилями значителен прирост дохода, что указывает на то, что хотя бы половина фильмов имеет доходы выше среднего уровня для первой четверти. Верхняя четверть фильмов имеет значительно более высокие доходы, чем остальные. Высокий показатель для 90-нр процентиля говорит о наличии нескольких фильмов с высокими доходами, которые можно отнести к выбросам и которые оказывают влияние на среднее значение, повышая его по отношению к медианному. Анализ процентилей показывает, что большинство фильмов имеют низкие или средние доходы, а лишь небольшая часть достигает высоких результатов.\n",
        "5 Медианное значение в 28 млн показывает, что половина фильмов будет иметь доход меньше этого, а половина - больше, что и видно на boxplot, а именно видно большой разброс значений в диапазоне от 150 до 900, при этом наблюдается \"кучность\" значений фильмов с меньшим бюджетом. Ввиду наличия большого количества выбросов, картинка на гистограмме получалась малоинформативной, в связи с чем пришлось удалять значения. После удаления значений и уменьшения ширины колонок график стал более информативным."

        "2. Наиболее часто встречаемым значением является 12A, которое встречается 788 раз. Это значение указывает на то, что фильмы с этой сертификацией предназначены для зрителей старше 12 лет, но могут быть просмотрены детьми младшего возраста с разрешением родителей.\n",

Например, если большая часть круговой диаграммы будет занята категориями 12A, 18 и PG, это будет свидетельствовать о том, что эти категории доминируют на рынке.\n"

Таким образом, связь режиссер - сертификат присутствует, хотя и не прямая, так как режиссеры в основном снимают фильмы под определенную аудиторию, а уже аудитория подходит под определенный сертификат.\n",
        "2 Для некоторых режиссеров распределение сертификатов выглядят схожим, что может говорить о том, что они работают в схожих жанрах или нацелены на одну и ту же аудиторию. В то же время, значительные различия в распределениях могут указывать на уникальные подходы каждого режиссера к созданию фильмов."

        "На диаграммах представлены 2 признака - рейтинг фильма и кассовые сборы. Распределение кассовых сборов значительно меняется в зависимости от рейтинга фильмов. Наапример, рейтинг PG показывает высокое медианное значение по сравнению с фильмами без рейтинга Not rated и с рейтингом R. PG демонстрирует высокое значение медианы в совокупности с большим размахом, что указывает на популярность таких фильмов. Медиана кассовых сборов коррелирует с рейтингом фильмов. Фильмы с рейтингом PG как правило доступны большей аудитории и поэтому чаще имеют более высокие кассовые сборы. Фильмы с рейтингами R и NotRated имеют более низкие кассовые сборы, что может быть обусловлено более узкой целевой аудиторией или специфическими жанрами. Размах кассовых сборов также варьируется в зависимости от рейтинга, что указыввет на различную степень коммерческого успеха фильмов с разным рейтингом. Стоит учитывать, что отдельное влияние на каждый фильм будут оказывать другие факторы - например, насколько обширно рекламировался фильм, какой у него актерский состав и известность режиссера.\n",

        "На основе проведенного анализа данных о доходах фильмов и их сертификациях можно сделать следующие обобщенные выводы:\n",
        "\n",
        "Разнообразие доходов: Диапазон доходов фильмов варьируется от 0.01 до 936 миллионов, что свидетельствует о значительном разбросе. Среднее значение дохода составляет около 49 миллионов, в то время как медианное значение — 28 миллионов. Это различие указывает на наличие выбросов, таких как фильмы с очень высокими доходами, которые искажают среднее значение.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Распределение доходов: Анализ процентилей показывает, что большинство фильмов имеют низкие или средние доходы. Например, 50% фильмов имеют доход ниже 28.345 миллионов. При этом верхняя четверть фильмов демонстрирует значительно более высокие доходы, что подтверждает наличие нескольких успешных проектов, оказывающих влияние на средние показатели.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Сертификация фильмов: В исследуемом наборе данных представлено 13 уникальных значений сертификаций, при этом наиболее распространенной является категория 12A (788 случаев). Это говорит о том, что большинство фильмов ориентированы на широкую аудиторию, включая подростков и взрослых. Небольшое количество фильмов не получило сертификацию или было запрещено.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Взаимосвязь между признаками: Слабая взаимосвязь наблюдается между длительностью фильма и его кассовыми сборами, что указывает на то, что успех фильма не всегда зависит от его продолжительности. Также выявлена зависимость между рейтингом фильма и его кассовыми сборами: фильмы с рейтингом PG показывают более высокие медианные значения по сравнению с фильмами без рейтинга или с рейтингом R.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Аудитория и жанр: Распределение сертификаций по фильмам различных режиссеров демонстрирует, что каждый режиссер имеет свою целевую аудиторию. Сходство в распределении сертификаций у некоторых режиссеров может указывать на схожесть жанров или целевой аудитории.\n",
        "\n",
        "Рейтинг фильиа и кассовые сборы: Распределение показало, что наилучшие кассовые сборы в целом будут у фильмов, имеющих более широкую аудиторию за счет большого охвата. Однако, стоит учитывать, что на кассовые сборы отдельного фильма могут повлиять такие факторы как популярность актеров, режиссера, наличие/отсутствие рекламы для увеличения охвата аудитории, изменение таких факторов может повлиять на сборы фильмов как в меньшую, так и в большую сторону.\n",
        "\n",
        "Таким образом, анализ показывает наличие значительного разброса в доходах фильмов и разнообразие их сертификаций. Большинство фильмов имеют низкий или средний уровень доходов, в то время как лишь небольшая часть достигает высоких результатов. Сертификация также играет важную роль в определении целевой аудитории и коммерческого успеха фильмов, особенно для категорий, доступных широкой публике."
